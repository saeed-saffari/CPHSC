# CPHSC

This repository stores the JSON files and supporting code used to build interactive visualizations for the CPHSC hospital food emissions project. These files are used on the Pagecloud website to render charts such as Sankey diagrams, category breakdowns, and other interactive graphics. The goal is to keep the processed data, models, and web-ready outputs in one place so they can be updated and reused easily across the project.
